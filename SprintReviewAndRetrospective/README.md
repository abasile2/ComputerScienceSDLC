## How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

Using the user stories helped me understand user needs. Understanding those needs and figuring out what details it would require would help make the program be successful. A program will not be successful without knowing the user's needs, it is created for their purpose and we should know and understand exactly what they expect from the program. 

## How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

The most important thing to do when approaching developing programs is to know what kind of program it is for and what it is meant to do. Some of the most important agile processes are plan, design, and test. It is a good idea to be prepared before starting to develop programns and it is ideal to test as often as possible to ensure that it is functional and that it is doing what it needs to do, while making it easier to keep an eye out for bugs in the code. 

## What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

To be a good team member in software development, I would say the most important thing to do is to communicate and network. This is something that would be successful only if every member of the team do their part and work together. Also, it would be beneficial to constantly ask questions and get a better understanding on what needs done and keep an open mind to learning new things.
